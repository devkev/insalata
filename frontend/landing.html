                    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                    <p>
                    The people in the houses would love to have some salad, but they have no ingredients. Please help connect them to the salad ingredients so they can make themselves a salad! <br/>

                    </p>
                    <h2>How to play:</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Each turn, you will get to draw a line between 2 different coloured tiles.<br/>
                            <img src=/assets/colors-this-move.png width=200px>
                            <li> The lines you have to choose from are highlighted - click on the one you want.<br />
                            <img src=/assets/pick-a-line.png width=400px>
                            <li> You score points every time you connect one of the 5 ingredients (bowl, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, salad dressing) to a house.<br/>
                            <img src=/assets/connected-to-house.png width=200px>
                            <li> Connecting a second copy of an ingredient to a house (does not need to be the same house as the first copy) often scores more points than the first!<br />
                            <img src=/assets/two-tomatoes.png width=300px>
                            <img src=/assets/points-table.png width=300px>
                            <li> When you connect the last instance of a single ingredient to a house, you get a bonus line! (You can draw any one line for free!)<br />
                            <img src=/assets/bonus-move.png width=200px>
                            <li> Connecting all 5 types of ingredients to a single house gets you a special bonus (that house can now have a complete salad, thank you!)<br/>
                            <img src=/assets/5-item-bonus.png width=300px>
                            <li> People don't just need salad, they also want to see each other. If you connect two houses with the same letter, you also score points!<br/>
                          <img src=/assets/connected-c.png width=300px>
                            <li> Don't forget to keep track how many turns are left in the round!<br />
                          <img src=/assets/turns-left.png width=200px>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Tips:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Connecting ingredients is cumulative per round, so try and connect them early!
                        <ol>
                          <li> For example, in Round 1 if you connect a lettuce, a tomato, and a dressing, you score (2 + 2 + 4) = 8 points for the round.<br />
                          <img src=/assets/points-table-1.png width=300px>
                          <li> In Round 2, if you additionally connect the second lettuce and both cucumbers, your total score for the round is (2 + 2) + 2 + (3 + 4) + 4 = 17 points.</br>
                          <img src=/assets/points-table-2.png width=300px>
                          <li> Your score over the two rounds is 8 + 17 = 25 points.
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Scoring:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your final score consists of:
                        <ol>
                          <li> Your score from connecting targets to houses, over 2 rounds. 
                          <li> 5 points for each pair of connected houses with the same letter.
                          <li> 15 points if you connect all 5 types of ingredients to a single house. (This only applies once per game).
                        </ol>
