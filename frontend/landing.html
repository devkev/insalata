                    An online game for connecting up to 8 players with SALAD!!!!!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                    <p>
                    The people in the houses would love to have some salad, but they have no ingredients. Please help connect them to the salad ingredients so they can make themselves a salad! <br/>

                    </p>
                    <h2>How to play:</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Each turn, you will get to draw a line between 2 different coloured tiles.
                            <li> The lines you have to choose from are highlighted - click on the one you want.
                            <li> You score points every time you connect one of the 5 ingredients (bowl, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, salad dressing) to a house.
                            <li> Connecting a second copy of an ingredient to a house (does not need to be the same house as the first copy) scores more points than the first!
                            <li> If all copies of an ingredient are connected to house(s), you get a bonus line! (You can draw any one line for free!)
                            <li> Connecting all 5 types of ingredients to a single house gets you a special bonus (that house can now have a complete salad, thank you!)
                            <li> People don't just need salad, they also want to see each other. If you connect two houses with the same letter, you also score points!
                            <li> Don't forget to keep track how many turns are left in the round!
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Scoring:</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                          <li> Each pair of connected houses scores 5 points.
                          <li> Connecting all 5 types of ingredients to a single house scores 15 points. (This only applies once per game).
                          <li> Connecting ingredients is cumulative per round, so try and connect them early!
                          <ol>
                            <li> For example, if you connect a lettuce and a tomato in the first round, you score (2 + 3) = 5 points.
                            <li> If you connect another lettuce and a cucumber in the second round, you score (2+2) = 4 for the lettuces, 3 for the tomato, and 3 for the cucumber, for a total of 10 points.
                          </ol>
                        </ol>
